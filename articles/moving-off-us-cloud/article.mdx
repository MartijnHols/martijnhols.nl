# I'm moving away from US cloud services

I've been skeptical of using US clouds for some time now. **Time and time again, data-sharing agreements between the EU and the US get busted**, showing there's just no legal compatibility between EU privacy rights and US spying laws. Every few years, it's [revealed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM) that the US is [spying more](https://www.wired.com/story/congress-spy-powers-fisa-ndaa-trump-702/) than expected. While everyone in the EU kinda knows storing personal data on US clouds is [pretty much impossible to do legally](/tooltip "European laws are in place to make it legal, but US laws are such that it can't be legal. This is why previous data sharing laws were all busted. So while the current laws might make it seem like you're good ok, in practice you aren't really."), they figure that since everyone is doing it, even if it's not legal, then [at least you'd be wrong with everyone else, so that makes it less bad](https://blog.iusmentis.com/2025/01/17/mag-ik-ondertussen-data-in-de-cloud-zetten-als-die-fysiek-in-europa-blijft/). And soon, it may become [fully illegal](https://noyb.eu/en/us-cloud-soon-illegal-trump-punches-first-hole-eu-us-data-deal).

But privacy isn't the only concern anymore. With the current political situation in the US, it's also starting to become clear that **our entire digital infrastructure is at the mercy of US policies**. [It is no longer safe to rely on US clouds for our governments and societies](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/you-can-no-longer-base-your-government-and-society-on-us-clouds/), as the US government can shut it down at will. And it [doesn't matter](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/servers-in-de-eu-eigen-sleutels-helpt-het/#wat-als-er-ruzie-is) whether the servers are in the EU.

This isn't just speculation. In 2019 GitHub started [blocking](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-starts-blocking-developers-in-countries-facing-us-trade-sanctions/) individual developers due to US trade sanctions. More recently, the US imposed new [sanctions on the International Criminal Court](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/06/trump-sanction-icc) in The Netherlands. These sanctions make it illegal for US companies to provide services to affected persons, essentially cutting them off from US services. This is a huge problem for them; [the ICC fears being cut off from all of their evidence](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/jan/20/international-criminal-court-icc-braces-swift-trump-sanctions-over-israeli-arrest-warrants), and [it may even shut the ICC down](https://www.justiceinfo.net/en/140499-can-the-icc-survive-the-u-s-sanctions-part-2.html#h-a-potential-threat-to-the-very-existence-of-the-court). This sets a dangerous precedent, and it increasingly appears that the US government will use tech companies as a weapon.

All things considered, **it's high time to move away from US cloud services**. In this article, I'll break down how I'm migrating away, what I switched to, and the challenges along the way.

## My dependencies

Before starting, I made an inventory of the US cloud services I depend on. I decided to focus on cloud services (and not software and hardware), as that's where the biggest risks are. My [complete](/tooltip "It's not as long as you might expect, as I've been preferring European services for a while now. For example, this site is hosted on OVH, a big French cloud service.") dependency list roughly in order of reliance:

- Microsoft Office 365
  - Mail
  - Calendar
  - OneDrive
- Bitwarden
- GitHub
- Google search
- Cloudflare/Google DNS
- Docker Hub
- NPM

This list is focused on cloud services I use professionally, but I plan to migrate personal services as well (privately I also rely on WhatsApp for communication and iCloud for backups and notes).

<Aside>
  While they're technically not cloud services, I also depend on online
  platforms like Hacker News, Reddit,
  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martijnhols/),
  [Twitter](https://x.com/MartijnHols) and
  [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/martijnhols.nl) and WhatsApp. I use social
  media like Hacker News and Reddit to reach people and stay informed, and
  LinkedIn, Twitter and BlueSky are ways for people to find and follow me. These
  platforms are only as good as the people on them, making most of them
  irreplaceable. Not because of their infrastructure, but because of their
  communities.
</Aside>

## Replacing the dependencies

With the list handy, I replaced each dependency.

### Goodbye Microsoft Office 365

Microsoft 365 is my main dependency. It has all of my mail, including history that I'm legally required to save, my calendar, and most of my important files, which also includes many files I'm legally required to save. Losing access to these services would be a total nightmare.

Additionally, I had long-standing usability issues with Microsoft 365, particularly with [OneDrive on Mac](/tooltip 'It was constantly draining my battery and overheating my CPU.'), which made the switch even more appealing.

I went looking for an all-in-one solution; mail, calendar and drive, mostly because it's simpler, and I don't want to pay for everything separately. In the end, I settled on [Proton](https://proton.me/). I had heard of Proton Mail before as a privacy-focused highly-encrypted mail provider, but never really looked into it as I had no real need for that, and I figured it would come at the cost of usability and price. But **I was seriously impressed by how good Proton software is.** Their apps are really [well-made and very usable](/tooltip "What the right kind of excited language for something as boring as mail, calendar, and storage? I don't really miss anything, and in general the UX is good. At the very least on average it's better than Microsoft's. Of course I do have some things I miss, like being able to switch month/week in calendar with one click, a right-click context menus, a Mail iOS widget, or the calendar one showing future events like the native iOS one does. All minor things if you ask me. But since I'm listing issues, you should know searching through Mail is a bit limited (since the encryption thing makes server-side searching impossible). I personally don't mind, and I read that they're working on it. Speaking of them working on things; they're active on Reddit and seem to actively be listening to feedback. You should watch some of their interviews to get a feeling for the company - they seem pretty passionate and cool."). I actually have a better experience than I did using Microsoft's. I'm impressed by how they made everything work so well without sacrificing privacy in any way.

<ProtonLogo

    width: 10em;
    float: right;
    margin-top: 0.5em;
    margin-left: 1em;
    margin-bottom: 1em;
  `}
  aria-label="Proton logo"
/>

The [Proton Business Suite](https://proton.me/business/plans), which includes 1 TB for Mail, Calendar, VPN, Pass and Drive, is only 12.99 per month (the non-business variant is 9.99). And just like Microsoft 365, it has full-fledged support for teams.

Another thing that impressed me by Proton, is that switching from Microsoft 365 is [a breeze](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/27/gmail-switch-proton-email/). Their [Easy Switch](https://proton.me/easyswitch) tool, handled all the data importing for me within a few clicks. All I had to do manually was update the DNS for my domains. And as a bonus, Proton allows setting up 15 custom email domains, so I can cancel all of my separate [email hosting](https://www.transip.nl/email-hosting/) and centralize all my mailboxes.

And yet another bonus: the Proton Business Plan includes a VPN. I only need one very occasionally, and every time I'm looking for a one time solution as my needs were never enough to subscribe to one, so this was a nice extra perk.

### Replacing Bitwarden

I was very hesitant to switch password managers. I'd used Bitwarden daily for over 4 years, and despite its usability issues, it had become a core part of my toolkit.

But as I really wanted to ditch US cloud services, I looked into replacing it. After all, even though my vaults are encrypted, they're still hosted by Bitwarden and they can restrict my access as they see fit.

The obvious place to start, was [Proton Pass](https://proton.me/pass), since it came [bundled](/tooltip "There's a generous free tier too.") with the Proton Business Suite. When I saw [1Password users switching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBdDYurOMyg), I figured it had to be good. And it is! **It has all of the features I used in Bitwarden, and more.** The main new things I appreciate are sharing password via a link, and the return of the login dropdown in login forms. Oh I missed you so.

<Figure caption="The dropdown opens automatically, so I can confirm a login with a single click">
  <Image

    width={500}
    alt='Shows a login form (Email or username and password) with an autofill overaly open with an option to login as "martijnhols"'
  />
</Figure>

Migration was even easier than Mail; just export in Bitwarden and import in Proton Pass, and you're done. Even TOTP codes and secure notes transfer over seamlessly.

### The GitHub challenge

I haven't migrated off GitHub yet. I'm deeply locked into GitHub, having [heavily customized](https://martijnhols.nl/blog/migrating-away-from-martijnhols-actions-cache) my [build pipelines](https://github.com/MartijnHols/martijnhols.nl/actions) to work within their platform.

GitHub only hosts my repositories and CI; I don't store any personal data on GitHub, nor do I use it to process it. I have copies of my repositories on my computer, plus occasional backups. The only real risk is if my Mac's SSD self-destructed at the exact same time, then I'd lose a few days of work.

Still, I'm highly dependent on GitHub with my projects, but migrating will take time. I will find a new home for my private repositories eventually, but considering the impact, this will probably be the final thing I migrate, so I haven't really started looking into alternatives yet.

### Escaping Google search (almost)

If you've tried alternative search engines, you know: Google search is really, really good. It's very hard to find an alternative that doesn't make you want to switch back.

But I found it: [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/)

<Figure caption="Try for yourself">
  <div
    className="img"
    style={{
      padding: '1em',
    }}
  >
    <StartpageSearch />
  </div>
</Figure>

Startpage is a Dutch-owned search engine that promises "uncompromising" privacy. Despite that, **I was really surprised by how good its search results are.** Turns out that's because it's actually a Google proxy. Bummer.

The privacy consequences of Startpage being a Google proxy are unclear, but it's still a a lot better than using plain Google. It doesn't remove the US cloud dependency though. Unfortunately, real European alternatives that don't make me want to switch back are scarce.

### Disconnecting Cloudflare/Google DNS

The promise of optimal DNS performance attracted me to the DNS servers of Cloudflare and Google. As part of this de-US-ing, I've opted to replace those with [Quad9](https://www.quad9.net/). Quad9 is a Swiss-based free DNS service focused on [security](/tooltip 'Its recommended DNS server includes blocking sites known to be serving malware, but you can also select one without this security feature.') and privacy.

Switching to Quad9 is easy; just pop in these numbers in your router: https://www.quad9.net/service/service-addresses-and-features#rec or [install a provisioning profile on mobile](https://docs.quad9.net/)

### Ditching Docker Hub

Docker Hub (a registry for Docker images) is essential to my CD pipeline; it stores the private images that my servers [automatically pull](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) to install new versions of my apps.

I'm quite eager to switch off of Docker Hub. I haven't been fan of Docker Inc. for a long time; they make it really obvious their focus is entirely on enterprise customers. Docker started going downhill when they [shutdown Docker Cloud](https://old.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/85w2vd/docker_cloud_is_shutting_down/). Later, they even canceled my subscription based on their "fair use" clause, because they misinterpreted their logs (they were counting [HTTP Head requests](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower/discussions/668) as image pulls).

Given my simple needs, self-hosting seems like the best option, so I'm probably going with [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/). But before I can set it up, I need to find a persistent storage solution for my servers. I've been putting this off as it hasn't really been essential [recently](/tooltip 'In other projects I used TransIP BigStorage for this. But since I switched to dedicated servers, I no longer use TransIP so I need something that works on other platforms as well.'). OVH or Scaleway Object Storage seem like good fits, but I need to do more research before finalizing a choice.

My deadline for this migration is July 1st, as that's when my Docker plan expires. But I'll probably finish this in the next few weeks to get this migration off the US cloud over with.

### NPM

For NPM, a key challenge is the reliance on public packages. These are downloaded and installed in every build in CI, and every time someone clones the project. While these are heavily cached, NPM becoming unavailable would make break most tooling. An alternative is needed.

Unfortunately I couldn't find any public European NPM mirrors (let me know if I missed any). I think this may be because most (big) companies host their own private mirrors. I've used [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/) as a private registry and cache before. Setting it up should be fairly easy to do with a Docker image. But like the Docker registry, this requires setting up persistent storage first. Once storage is good to go, I'll set this up. That way, if NPM becomes unavailable, I'll still have access to the versions I've been using, and I can get other people up to speed with them.

## Wrapping up

Migrating off the US cloud is a lot easier than I expected. While there are some challenges left to tackle, migrating my main dependency (Microsoft 365) was done in an afternoon. This is mainly thanks to Proton, which turned out to be a surprisingly good alternative to Microsoft 365.

Other moves, like replacing Docker Hub and NPM, required a bit more planning. This was mostly because I hadn't solved persistent storage before—something I should have solved ages ago.

Some things, like GitHub, will take longer, but it's on my list and seems within reach. It even seems fun to explore European alternatives. Or maybe I'll self-host something.

On the other side is Google Search, which still feels unbeatable. [Hopefully more alternatives will pop up](/tooltip "It's interesting how there are so many AI competitors, but so few on search engines. I suppose there's not a lot of money in search engines, but with AI already running crawlers, maybe they can double dip?"), but for now using a more privacy-focused proxy seems to be the only viable option.

If you're thinking about reducing your reliance on US cloud services, now is a good time to make it so. It's getting harder to ignore the risks, both in terms of privacy and control over your own infrastructure. As my experience shows, some migrations may be a lot easier than you expect, while others can take more effort.

If nothing else, at least be aware of the risks before signing up for _new_ US services. Consider European services instead.

If you've gone through a similar transition, I'd love to hear what worked (or didn't work) for you.
