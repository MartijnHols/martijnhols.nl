      Many of the alternative frameworks use a crazy custom templating language
      that compiles back to JS. Let's take the first Vue example in their docs (
      <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html">source</a>);
    </p>

    <CodeSnippet>{`
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
const count = ref(0)
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="count++">Count is: {{ count }}</button>
</template>

<style scoped>
button {
  font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
`}</CodeSnippet>

      This isn't even a <Code>.js</Code> file, it's a <Code>.vue</Code> file. To
      work with it in an IDE, you'll need to install an extension.
    </p>

    <p>
      But to understand it, you need to learn a completely new syntax. This
      seems easy enough to understand, but writing it is going to be a
      completely different story. The only way you can learn to even just make
      something like a basic loop (and there are a bunch of different ways to
      loop) is to consult the docs. It's a completely custom syntax so you need
      to learn this custom syntax from the ground up, and that knowledge isn't
      applicable to anything else.
    </p>

    <p>
      In contrast,{' '}
      <strong>
        JavaScript is applicable to every web app/site and even Node.js
      </strong>
      . Even the libraries you use are all in native JavaScript (with TypeScript
      types available). That language is going somewhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this snippet to work: <Code>{`<button @click="count++">`}</Code>, you
      need to rely on framework-magic. I get that <Code>@click</Code> binds
      something to the click event, but how the hell would "count++" ever be
      executed if not for framework-magic? Not to mention that putting code
      inside a string is just a terrible idea. Now you need IDE extensions to do
      anything with it, as native JavaScript analysis and refactoring tools
      won't be able to recognize it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Oh and that loop thing?{' '}
      <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/list">This is it</a>, buddy:{' '}
      <Code>{`<li v-for="item in items">`}</Code>
    </p>

    <p>
      I just don't understand how anyone could prefer that over React's native
      JS. What is so wrong about native JS, these frameworks felt the need to
      reinvent the wheel? This obviously just leads to many problems that they
      had to solve with even more custom syntax. Sure, there are IDE extensions
      to make it easier to work with, but that just seems like forcing a bad
      design decision through a workaround. Meanwhile I don't need a single
      extension for React code, and I can put it in any regular old JavaScript
      file.
    </p>

    <Aside>
      Angular has all the same issues and more. The insanity starts with a
      syntax like <Code>{`<button [disabled]="hasPendingChanges">`}</Code> and{' '}
      <Code>{`<section class="admin-controls" *ngIf="hasAdminPrivileges">The content you are looking for is here.</section>`}</Code>
      , but it goes completely bonkers when you dive into all the classes and
      services that you needâ€” even for basic things like adding up values.
      (Controversial opinion: I really don't think OOP is a good fit for
      JavaScript.) I reckon the reason they don't show a basic complete
      component in their{' '}
      <a href="https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular">docs</a>, is because it
      would get so long and weird that anyone still sane would be scared away.
    </Aside>

    <p>
      Thankfully, React is{' '}
      <a href="https://npmtrends.com/@angular/core-vs-angular-vs-react-vs-vue">
        by far the most popular
      </a>{' '}
      front-end{' '}
      <Annotation annotation="I know React is a library and not a framework, but once you combine it with React-libraries for global state management, networking and forms, you're effectively working with a framework.">
        framework
      </Annotation>
      . That means I wouldn't even consider the alternatives if I had to choose
      today, as nearly always the biggest library that is still growing in
      popularity is the best choice. Hopefully you will make the same decision.
